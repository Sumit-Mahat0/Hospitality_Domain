🌟 Excited to Share My Latest Project!

I recently completed a detailed data analysis for Atliq Grands, a well-known hotel chain with a strong presence in major Indian cities like Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, and Hyderabad. 🏨

📊 The project involved analyzing booking data from various channels, including their website and popular platforms like MakeMyTrip, LogTrip, and Tripster. 🌐

🔍 Using tools like Python and pandas, I uncovered key insights, including a decline in market share and revenue, which highlighted areas for improvement. 🚀

💡 Working closely with Atliq's management team, we turned these insights into actionable strategies to improve customer experience, enhance bookings, and drive revenue growth. 📈

🎯Project Approach:

➡️Collected and cleaned booking data, guest demographics, and stay details.
➡️Preprocessed the data, handling missing values and outliers.
➡️Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to discover trends.  
➡️Created data visualizations to highlight key findings.

🎯Outcomes:

➡️Identified customer preferences, peak booking seasons, and behavior trends.

➡️Delivered insights to enhance customer satisfaction and streamline operations.

➡️Produced visual reports to guide strategic decisions.
